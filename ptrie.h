 *     lectures.
 * - `@return` - Return `0` upon successful addition. Return `-1` if
 *     the `str` could not be added due to `malloc` failure, or if the
 *     string has invalid characters (ascii values < 32, see

 * a prefix. If two strings with an *equal* frequency of addition have
 * prefixes that match the `str`, the one with a lower
 * `ptrie_char2off` value is the one returned (see the helper in
 * `ptrie.c`).

 * struct ptrie *pt = ptrie_allocate();
 * ptrie_add(pt, "he");
 * ptrie_add(pt, "hey");
